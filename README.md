Goal:

Create a basic rock, paper, scissors function that takes in a user input, compare it with a random selection, and determine the winner after 5 rounds.

Skills demonstrated:

1. Create, call, and return the function's value.
2. Store data in variable.
3. Use if conditionals with comparison and boolean operators.
4. Pass arguments into parameters.
5. Make input case insensitive using str meth.
6. Create multiple nested if statements.
7. Utilize a for loop.
8. Call a function within a function.
9. Add 1 to a counter to keep track of score.
10. Utilize prompt function and store in a var.
11. Use template literals.
12. Console.log things.
13. Solve sub-problems to solve the bigger ones and test each component before moving on.
14. Google things.

Take-away:

1. How to generate integers randomly using math floor and random functions.
2. Multiple nested if statements for each common if statement require the same structure.
3. Score variables should be kept outside of the loop, lest it stays at the initial value.

Future implementation:

1. GUI
2. Spelling sensitivity
